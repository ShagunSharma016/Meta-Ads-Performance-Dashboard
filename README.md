### 🎯 Project Overview  
This project was a personal challenge — I analyzed **Meta Ads data** even though I had never used **Facebook** or **Instagram** before.  
(The only Meta product I had used before this was **WhatsApp** ).  

I wanted to understand how marketing analytics works — how businesses measure ad success, optimize spend, and engage audiences.  
So, I built a **Power BI dashboard** visualizing ad performance, engagement, and ROI for both **Facebook** and **Instagram** campaigns.  

It became a perfect blend of **data analysis, storytelling, and marketing logic** — one of my most insightful projects so far.

### 🎯 Project Overview  
This project was a personal challenge — I wanted to analyze **Meta Ads data** even though I had never used **Facebook** or **Instagram** before.  
(The only Meta product I had used before this was **WhatsApp**).  

I wanted to understand how marketing analytics works — how businesses measure success, optimize ad spend, and engage audiences.  
So, I built a **Power BI dashboard** that visualizes ad performance, engagement, and ROI across **Facebook** and **Instagram** campaigns.  

This project became a great mix of **data analysis, design, and marketing logic** — and it turned out to be one of my most insightful builds so far.
